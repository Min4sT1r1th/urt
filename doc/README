****************************************************************
Note for version 3.0: Some of the descriptions in these papers no
longer reflect reality in their details.  The substance is correct,
but some of the functions and commands have changed their names and/or
arguments and calling sequences.  In particular, the functions named
'sv_xxx' are now called 'rle_xxx' (except sv_setup, which changed to
rle_put_setup, and lost an argument).  The 'comp' program, used
heavily in the 'toolkit' paper is now called 'rlecomp', and the
command syntax has changed slightly.  The arguments to the 'fant'
program have changed, too.  See the man pages.

This is the non-man-page documentation for the Raster Toolkit.  They are
formatted with the Scribe document processing system (tm Unilogic, Inc.).

In the likely event that you don't have Scribe running on your system,
two forms of scribe output are provided.  The ".ps" files contain PostScript
descriptions, for devices like the Apple LaserWriter.  The ".doc" files
are vanilla text output, without the PostScript figures.

The files are:

rle.mss		- "The Design of the Utah RLE Format"
rle.doc		- Text version of the above
rle.ps		- PostScript version of the above (figures included).
rle_head.ps	- PostScript figures used in the above paper.
rleops.ps

toolkit.mss	- "The Utah Raster Toolkit"  Read comments at the top for
		  hints on Scribing it.
toolkit.bib	- Bibliography for the above
toolkit.doc	- Text version
toolkit.ps	- PostScript version, without the figures.
pics/		- PostScript versions of the images used in the paper.

Because the toolkit paper takes a long time (> 30 min) to print if the
figures are included, they are left out of the .ps file.  They can be
printed individually by doing something like:

	echo showpage | cat pics/dart_shadow_and_monkey.ps - | lpr -Plw
