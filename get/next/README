========================================================
This is a little RLE (Utah Raster tool kit) file viewer.
========================================================

There is GIF viewers for the NeXT, so i thought that it was time that
someone wrote a RLE/RASF viewer for the NeXT. 

The source is included but you need to have the utah raster toolkit
version 3.0 installed on your system to compile it.  
(the include files and libraries for the utah raster toolkit)
(should be installed in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include)
The code that reads and write GraphicsLand Raster Files (rasf) is
included 

I'd like to thank Robert Hood, for his NeXTGIF program which RLEViewer
is heavily based on.

This program is in the Public Domain, all I ask is that if you make
any improvements or Bug fixes, you should let me know.


==========================================================================
See the ChangeLog file for a list of differences between this and
latter versions of RLEViewer

Note added by SWT:

Assuming IB.proj is not automatically generated (I don't have a NeXT,
so I don't know how these things work), you will need to uudecode
IB.proj.uu.

Same goes for RLEViewer.nib.uu.

You will also need to uudecode all the *.tiff.uu files.

The 3.1 changes have not been tested.
