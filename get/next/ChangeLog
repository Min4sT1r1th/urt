	* The GraphicsLand Raster File viewer finally works thanks to
	Thomas Orth (orth@cpsc.ucalgary.ca).  I knew I shouldn't have used
	the code from the GraphicsLand Library.

	* The program will now allow you to select if you want to save the
	rle file as a tiff or as a encapsulated postscript file though an
	accessory view in the save panel object.  (this program is getting
	real big isn't it).  Only bug left is the bug dealing with .rasf
	files

	* All bugs seem to be fixed now, only the opening of .rasf files
	seems to be messed up.

	* Now when you iconify a window, an icon representing the file
	type is displayed in the miniWindow

	* Added a print option and a save option.  There is a bug in the
	save option when saving RLE files, the resulting file is upside
	down i'm not sure how to fix this.  (Boy this program is getting
	big can we say creaping featurism?????)

	* Added an Edit option in the main menu so you could cut stuff out
	of the help panel.  Also the text in the help panel is now no
	longer editable.  Made the RLE and RASF objects subclasses of the
	Image class which is a subclass of View.  The RLE and RASF objects
	now only implement a openFile: method, after the data has been
	read in the displayImage method from the Image Class is called and
	a window is put up on the screen.

	* Version 2.1.  Fixed up how the alpha channel is handled in
	images.  The alpha channel is now properly handled in utah raster
	files that contain the alpha channel. (The GraphicsLand Raster
	File viewer portion of the program still has some bugs in it.  If
	i knew what the bugs were i might be able to fix them)

	* Version 2.0
	Added the Ability to view GraphicsLand Raster Files (.rasf)

Tue Jun  4 23:39:29 1991  Vince DeMarco  (vince at whatnext)

	* Changes Since version 1.0.  
	The program will no longer crash when a rle file has less than 3
	colors in the color table.  the program will no assume an error
	has occured tell the user about it, and assume that 3 colors are
	supposed to be present in the file.
