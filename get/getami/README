Getami requires the qsort routine. If you are using Lattice C, be warned that
Lattice's qsort is poorly written, requiring tremendous amounts of stack. (To
run getami, you need a stack somewhere between 300000 and 350000 bytes!) I would
therefore recommend that you use a different qsort, like the Berkeley one,
available from uunet. I notified Lattice about the problem, but they did not fix
it in release 5.10b. Hopefully, they will do so in the next one.

Getami also requires getopt to parse its arguments. (I don't speak scanargs!)
You can use any of the various versions floating around, like the GNU (requires
alloca), or the Berkeley version.

Finally, if you want to save pictures rendered with getami as IFF files, you
will need a copy of Christian Weber's iff.library, available on one of the
Fred Fish disks. If you don't have this library, to compile getami, add
-dNOIFFLIB to CFLAGS.

The current version of getami was developed using Lattice C. The original
program was developed using Aztec C, and an attempt has been made to ensure
that the program compiles in both environments. However, as I only have
Lattice C, I cannot be absolutely certain about this claim. Let me know of
any changes required to make getami compile using Aztec C.
